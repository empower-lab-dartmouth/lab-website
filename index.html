		<p><br>In the Empower Lab, we conduct research to design, engineer, and evaluate technology to <br>promote human wellbeing as well as the wellness of the natural environment on which all life depends. <br><br>
		We specifically focus on developing interactive, data-driven tools that empower people to <br>individually and collectively create, make sense of, and act upon information, with an emphasis on societally impactful applications in health, education, civics, and sustainability.
