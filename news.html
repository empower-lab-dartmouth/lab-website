					<p>Attention sophomore and junior women! The engineering department still has Luce fellowships available, which can sponsor your research with our lab. The fellowship covers 3 terms of support (total stipend of $7000) and a small amount in research supplies ($2000-$3000). To apply, you'd need to be a U.S. citizens or permanent resident (required by the foundation), have declared (or intend to declare) an engineering major, and commit to 3 terms of research: 2 "on" terms (while taking classes) and 1 "off" term (full time research). If interested, please research out to Liz who can help match you with a project and assist with preparing the application materials, which include a statement of research and a recent resume. (To learn more about current openings, check the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page for projects marked with a <i>"Recruiting students"</i> note).</p>

					With CS professor XD Yang, Liz is helping put together a "DartmouthCHI" virtual event to showcase exciting research by members of our fast-growing HCI community at Dartmouth. At this 3-hour mini-conference, faculty and grad students from Thayer, CS, and collaborating universities will deliver presentations for their papers published at <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/">CHI 2020</a>, the flagship conference in HCI, which was unfortunately cancelled due to the pandemic. Talks will cover a range of topics including sensing, wearables, smart things, education, and health. This is a great opportunity to learn about HCI. Feel welcome to share broadly — hope to see you there!
